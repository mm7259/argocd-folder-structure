This repository demonstrates how to organize K8s manifests based on the environements. 

Each branch represents an environment 

Each folder represents an application

Once the infrastructure manifests are applied and test in the lower environments, a Pull Request can be created to merge the branch for the lower environment to that of a higher environment.
